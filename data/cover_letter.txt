Dear Ms. Morris,

I am writing to apply to the Spring 2016 public relations internship at LaForce + Stevens. The agency’s
innovative digital branding strategies, especially for high-end fashion clients, are redefining the industry,
particularly in its work with Perry Ellis. My experience in public relations and background in fashion
design would make me a great fit for the fast-paced LaForce + Stevens team.

As an account executive at PRLab at Boston University, I created a social media strategy for my client
Ben & Jerry’s. I collaborated with other account executives to integrate innovative ideas into our online
brand conversations to engage potential and existing followers. Throughout the semester, we have
increased social media followers by 45% and engaged the community—especially the thousands of
Boston-area students—in the brand through traditional and social media. In addition, I built a media list
for Ben & Jerry’s of contacts in local, college, and national media to gain more earned coverage for the
brand. So far, two local papers have published articles based on the press kit I assembled and pitches I
wrote to journalists.

In addition to my social media experience, I have been designing and making clothes for years in class
and on my own. I understand the demands of the fashion industry and have the keen sense of style
necessary to create brand strategies that compellingly represent high-end fashion brands. From my
public relations experience and background in fashion, I would be an enthusiastic, creative asset to the
public relations department here.

I look forward to talking to you further about my skills and qualifications for the spring 2016 public
relations internship at LaForce + Stevens. I can be reached by phone at (617) 353-3490 and email at
dmeagle@bu.edu. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Jessica Jones
